# The _rv32_ RISC-V ISS Model

The include files in this folder are an abbreviated set of headers for using
the librv32[xxx].a libraries containing the RISC-V RV32 ISS. The full source
code and [documentation](https://github.com/wyvernSemi/riscV/blob/main/iss/doc/iss_manual.pdf)
is available on github at:

[https://github.com/wyvernSemi/riscV/tree/main/iss](https://github.com/wyvernSemi/riscV/tree/main/iss)

To use the ISS, the co-simulation code must include rv32.h and link the library
(`-lrv32`) in `CoSim/lib`.

If the gdb remote target wrapper interface is to be used then `rv32_cpu_gdb.h`
must also be included. Then, in place of a call to the model's `run()` method&mdash;
`pCpu->run(cfg)`&mdash;a call to the gdb wrapper function is made:

```
rv32gdb_process_gdb(pCpu, cfg.gdb_ip_portnum, cfg);
```

This will open a TCP/IP socket and listen for the gdb remote target connection.
The `makefile` in the `CoSim` directory can be called to link the ISS library as follows (e.g. in
a bash script):

```
    #!/bin/bash
    OSVVMDIR=<absolute path>/OsvvmLibraries
    SIMDIR=`pwd`
    
    make -C $OSVVMDIR/CoSim              \
            OPDIR=$SIMDIR                \
            USRCDIR=$OSVVMDIR/CoSim/iss  \
            USRFLAGS="-I $OSVVMDIR/CoSim/include -L $OSVVMDIR/CoSim/lib -lrv32"
```
