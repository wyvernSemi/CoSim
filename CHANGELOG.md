## 2026.08 August 2026
- Added support for DLL and PHY traffic generation over MIT for PCIe VC with
  new commands to both generate and receive DLL packets and generated PHY TS/OS
  traffic and retrieve TS/OS RX event counts.
- Added support for burst word transactions in addtion to byte bursts
- Updated the rv32 RISC-V ISS library to latest v1.3.6 version
- Added a new JFIF library for decoding JFIF/JPEG image files
- Added two new non-regression demonstration tests: one for using GTK+ 3.0 library with JFIF library, and one for rv32 application to compress data with LZW code
- Added a VHDL co-simulation procedure to call a user defined callback function with type and value arguments. This is was added mainly to have a means for a clock count to be passed to the C/C++ domain for synchronising time between logic simulation and software, but it can be used for sending any kind of data.

## 2026.01 January 2026
- Added the inclusion of the PCIe C model to CoSim library compilation.
  These new libraries exits in `PCIe/lib`, with headers in `PCIe/include`
- Changes in support of PCIe VC, including adding support for `SetModelOptions` and `GetModelOptions`
- Added a `VIrq` co-simulation procedure, wrapped in a new `CoSimIrq` VHDL procedure,
  to raise interrupts independent of `CoSimTrans` where required
- The rv32 RISC-V instruction set simulator library is updated to verion 1.3.1. New features include:
  - API access to internal cycle count
  - Registering of callback function on unimplemented instruction
  - Internal timing model configurable over API
  - Generation of software interrupt over external IRQ callback
  - Support for RV32B standard extensions (Zba, Zbb and Zbs)
  - Support for RV32_Zbc standard extension
  - Reading of binary program in addition to ELF support


## 2024.07 July 2024
- Updated calls to CreateClock for it being moved to ClockResetPkg

## 2023.07 July 2023
- Updates RISC-V ISS rv32 libraries and include headers for new features and fixes to support running FreeRTOS real-time operating system

## 2023.05 May 2023
- Added split transaction methods for address bus model independent manager
- Added support address bus model independent subordinate/responder
- Added support for streaming bus model independent transactions
- Added test data pattren generation methods
- Added data check methods

## 2023.01 January 2023
- New repository with ability to run C code in the testbench in a CoSim environment.  See README.md
